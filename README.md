In this project, I attempt to analyze the data on survivors of the Titanic and use insights gained from this in order to predict whether or not another set of passengers would have survived. I have primarily used Numpy and Pandas for data analysis and pyplot and seaborn for data visualization. I have also implemented a logistic regression classifier based on Stanford University's Machine Learning Course (available on Coursera) in this notebook, and this gives an accuracy of ~76% on the test set (in the top 25% of all participants). 

In the notebook Titanic_ML_2, I have implemented a Random Forest Classifier that improves upon the classifier in this notebook, and predicts survival rates with an accuracy of ~80% (in the top 8% of all participants)
